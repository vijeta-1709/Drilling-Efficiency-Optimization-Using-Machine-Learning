Drilling Efficiency Optimisation Using Machine Learning
Optimise drilling operations by predicting ROP (Rate of Penetration) based on drilling parameters

Features considered in this problem:

Depth(ft): 1000 to 5000 ft

WOB(klbf): Weight on Bit

RPM: Rotary Speed

Torque(ft-lbf): Derived from WOB and RPM

Flow Rate(gpm): Mud flow rate

Bit Dull Grade: Bit condition from 0 (new) to 8 (worn out)

Mud Weight(ppg): Density of the drilling fluid

MSE: Mechanical Specific Energy (calculated)

Formation Type: Categorical (Shale, Sandstone, Limestone)

ROP(ft/hr): Target â€“ Rate of Penetration
